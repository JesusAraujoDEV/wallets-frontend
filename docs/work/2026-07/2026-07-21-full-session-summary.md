# 2026-07-21 — Full session summary (wallets-frontend + wallets-backend)

Chronological record of technical work done in one continuous session. Companion to atomic work-log entries. A matching copy lives in `wallets-backend/docs/work/2026-07/`.

---

## 1. God Component refactor (frontend)

Identified 17 files violating the project's size ceilings (component ≤150, page ≤200, hook ≤80). Split all 17 via parallel background agents, each producing a thin orchestrator plus a feature subdirectory. Verified with `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` per batch.

Net effect: `Subscriptions.tsx` 1102→133, `Profile.tsx` 858→54, `CalendarView.tsx` 653→155, etc. — 17 files decomposed into ~140 new files, all under ceiling.

## 2. Backend "God File" audit (read-only)

Audited `wallets-backend/server/` against ceilings (service ≤150, generic module ≤200). Found 6 oversized services + 1 controller + 9 Swagger files. Wrote `wallets-backend/docs/audits/2026-07-17-god-files-audit.md` with split plan using the existing `stats/`/`transactions/` pattern as reference.

## 3. Notion integration — Platica sync mechanism

- Connected backend to production database for real data operations.
- Created a structured Notion sync workflow: parent page for all sync entries, with dated sub-entries documenting each batch of changes.
- Implemented Notion page creation/update via MCP tools for financial record keeping.

## 4. Account/category/budget CRUD operations

- Exercised the full account creation flow (new account types, balance corrections).
- Tested category creation for missing expense categories.
- Created 7 monthly budgets, later corrected amounts and tagged with `rate_source`.
- Debt record creation (payable type, with due date).

## 5. Notion page consolidation

Refactored from per-session top-level pages to a single parent page with child entries. All future sync entries nest under one page.

## 6. Exchange rate operations

- Updated exchange rate rows with real BCV values.
- Validated rate lookup/fallback behavior for weekends and missing dates.

## 7. Budget "0% used" bug — found and fixed

`aggregateSpentByCategory` required a category to belong to a `CategoryGroup` with `analyticsBehavior: 'include'` via inner join. Categories without a group (common case) were silently excluded from budget totals. Fixed by treating groupless categories as included by default.

## 8. Rate-source tagging feature

- Added migration (`add-rate-source-to-budgets`), model field, Joi validation, service wiring.
- Frontend: selector + badge in budget cards/forms.
- Found and fixed the conversion bug: `rate_source: 'eur'` never triggered real EUR→USD conversion for comparison. Added `budgetedInUsd()` to handle foreign-currency budget amounts.

## 9. Full-app i18n audit

- Grepped entire `src/` for hardcoded Spanish outside `t()` calls: 70 files found.
- Dispatched 7 parallel agents by feature domain to convert files to `useTranslation()`/`t()`.
- Merged 471 keys across `es.json`/`en.json`/`de.json` in one script pass.
- Final grep: 0 remaining hardcoded strings.

---

## Code changes (backend)

- `budget_service.js` split into `budgets/{crud,status,period_helpers}.js`.
- `aggregateSpentByCategory` groupless-category bug fixed.
- `rate_source` column + validation + EUR-conversion logic added to budgets.
- `exchange_rate_worker_service.js` self-healing sync (multiple runs/day + startup sync).
- `comparative_mom`/`comparative_mom_income` custom date-range support.

## Code changes (frontend)

- 17 God Components decomposed (~140 new files).
- Statistics page with flexible period comparison.
- Login form split + password show/hide toggle.
- Budget rate-source UI (selector + badge + original-amount display).
- 70-file app-wide i18n conversion, 471 new locale keys across `es`/`en`/`de`.
